Twitter Responsive App.

This is a side project which was meant to put into practice general and deep knowledge of different web development
skills and technologies. It accounts with some screen shots so you can have a view of the general look and feel of this
web responsive Twitter application version.

Includes the following main features and some more not mentioned:
1)Cutting-edge technologies: All was done based in the HTML 5 principles (plus JavaScript and CSS3 in general), also used
AngularJs framework for coding and asynchronous module definition of the core logic, also used nodeJs with ExpressJs framework
for setting up routes, viewing engine, authentication, database access (MongoDB) and more.
2)Responsive: Main logged in menu reacts with the help of media queries, so it responds depending on the viewport.
3)Sessions: You need to be authenticated as a user in the database in order to access to the main page.
4)Viewing and templating engine: It uses the built-in angular directives for prompting each of the tweets, having their
own scope according to the Angular framework definition, also used DustJS templating open source engine for generating
the suggestions to follow on the upper-left section of the screen when in full size.
